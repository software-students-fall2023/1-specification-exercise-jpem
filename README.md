2. There is a lot of repeated paperwork when searching for an animal

Stakeholder Goals and Needs

1. Want to be able to find mental support easiliy through an application
2. Want to find animals that match their personality type.
3. Want to find animals from verified shelters and not have to worry about getting scammed.
